# One Patient Left
*A 2D narrative survival game in a semi-open world after a mysterious zombie pandemic.*

**One-liner:** You wake up alone in a silent hospital with no memory and no supplies. Piece together what happened to the city and to your family by sneaking, scavenging, and solving story-driven tasks—where every sound can be your last.

## Project Status
- Phase: Pre-production (concept & planning)
- MVP Target: 20–30 minute demo with the hospital + nearby neighborhood, 3 story quests, basic inventory, and stealth.

## Design Pillars
1. **Revealing Narrative** – every place/object reveals new truth.    
2. **Stealth over Violence**
3. **Coherent World** – open world, connected 2D maps, day/night, light & noise as mechanics.

## MVP Scope
- Player movement, interaction, inventory, stealth (vision cone + noise radius), 3 quests, 2 grounded puzzles.
- Save/load, options menu, basic accessibility (subtitles, difficulty presets).
